# Work Day Scheduler

## Overview

As an employee with a busy schedule, you need an efficient way to manage your daily tasks. The **Work Day Scheduler** is a simple calendar application designed to help you add and organize important events throughout the day. This browser-based app utilizes the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) library for seamless date and time manipulation.

## Features

### 1. Display Current Day

- The application prominently displays the current day at the top of the calendar, ensuring you are always aware of the date when you open the planner.

### 2. Timeblocks for Standard Business Hours

- As you scroll down, the planner presents timeblocks for standard business hours, providing a clear overview of your day.

### 3. Color-Coded Timeblocks

- Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it represents the past, present, or future. This visual cue allows you to quickly assess your schedule at a glance.

### 4. Event Entry

- Clicking on a timeblock allows you to enter an event, making it easy to input and update your schedule for each hour of the day.

### 5. Save Events to Local Storage

- A user-friendly save button within each timeblock enables you to save your entered events directly to local storage. This ensures that your schedule persists between page refreshes.

### 6. Persistent Event Storage

- The application goes beyond a single session by persistently storing your events in local storage. This means you can confidently close and reopen the page, knowing that your schedule will remain intact.
